## Summary

*Engineer by training, scientist by inclination.*

I am a software & machine learning engineer with 5+ years of experience in building full-stack, big data and machine learning applications. I have recently graduated from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) and obtained an advanced Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence with *Magna cum laude* distinction, while a shortened versison of my master's thesis was accepted as a full-paper in the [LIDTA-2022 workshop](https://lidta.dcc.fc.up.pt/), co-located with [ECML/PKDD 2022](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/).

I find the idea of pushing the human boundaries using technology exciting and motivating and I believe in the responsibility of making the world a better place for future generations. During my past roles, I managed to learn different technology stacks in short periods of time and I collaborated and exchanged knowledge and opinions with amazing people.
