## Summary

*Engineer by training, scientist by inclination.*

With 5+ years of experience in building big data and machine learning applications, I am currently finishing my thesis on automated anomaly detection as part of a master's programme in Artificial Intelligence at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). What motivates me: the idea of pushing the human boundaries using technology and making the world a better place for future generations.

I have been a member of the [*Intelligent Systems & Software Engineering Labgroup*](https://issel.ee.auth.gr/) at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2018-2021) and of the [*Informatics and Telematics Institute*](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx) at the
Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (2015-2016).
