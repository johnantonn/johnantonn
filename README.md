## About me

Trying to optimize a notoriously complex loss function by navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex space-time manifold, one small step at a time.

Most probably, so are you!

**My learnings from this mysterious journey**:
- Wisely choose the loss function(s) you want to optimize.
- Carefully choose your training data. This is what you'll be learning from.
- Adapt your learning rate accordingly; be careful not to overshoot.
- Make informative, small steps towards the right direction.
- Trust the power of the gradient but also enable clipping to keep it from exploding.
- Stay alert for you might overfit. Perhaps use some regularization.
- Don't expect to find any global minima.
- Escape the plateaus; you'll encounter plenty.
- Keep moving downhill!

## Education

I hold a diploma in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** (2015) and an advanced Master's degree in **Artificial Intelligence** (2022) from *KU Leuven*, Belgium. I was fortunate to have been educated by amazing professors, experts and mentors in the topics of **mathematics**, **physics**, **engineering** and **computer science**.

I have authored two papers:
- [Antoniadis, I., Vercruyssen, V. \& Davis, J.. (2022). Systematic Evaluation of CASH Search Strategies for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection. Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Learning with Imbalanced Domains: Theory and Applications, in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 183:8-22.](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v183/antoniadis22a)
- [I. I. Antoniadis, K. C. Chatzidimitriou and A. L. Symeonidis, "Security and Privacy for Smart Meters: A Data-Driven Mapping Study," 2019 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT-Europe), Bucharest, Romania, 2019, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ISGTEurope.2019.8905611.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8905611)

## Experience

My professional career started in 2015*, when I joined the [*Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH)*](https://www.iti.gr/iti/en/home/) as a **research associate**. There, I worked on a EU-funded project on cloud computing, when the field was still at its early stages, and collaborated with a large consortium of european institutions.

I continued my journey as a **software engineer** at [*Veltio*](https://veltio.com/), a company (Oracle golden partner) offering supply-chain automation solutions. I worked on real-world, large-scale problems alongside an exceptional group of colleagues and led the development of big data processing pipelines and automation systems that were used by major international actors, such as Sainsbury's, that drove significant growth and revenue.

I later joined the [*Intelligent Systems and Software Engineering Labgroup (ISSEL)*](https://issel.ee.auth.gr/en/13-2/) of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, AUTH, as a **research engineer**, where I was responsible for the development and technical management of an EU-funded project related to energy monitoring and load disaggregation in consumer installations. There, I had the opportunity to do applied ML research and contribute to the development of an event streaming platform for real-time data processing.

In July 2022 I joined [*Expedia Group*](https://www.expediagroup.com/home/default.aspx), London, as a **machine learning scientist**. As a member of the Content & Relevance team, I've worked on xlarge-scale ranking problems like review amd amenity ranking using **deep learning**, while also contributing to the development of internal ranking frameworks and libraries that are being used by multiple teams. My latest work involves enhancing contextualization and personalization for our models, LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, real-time inference using LLMs and multi-modal retrieval.

<sub>*Actually, my first job was in 2011 during my second-year studies at AUTH, where I worked as a part-time support representative at *OTE*, the largest telecommunications company in Greece.</sub>

## What motivates me

I find the idea of pushing the human boundaries using technology exciting and I believe in the responsibility of making the world a better place for future generations.

*All it takes is one small step at a time!*
