## Summary

*Engineer by training, scientist by inclination.*

During my 6+ years of professional experience, I had the opportunity to apply and improve my skills in software engineering, data science and machine learning, as well as research and technical management. I am currently working at [Expedia Group](https://www.expediagroup.com/home/default.aspx) (London) as a machine learning scientist, where I solve real-world, large-scale machine learning problems with the aim to empower travel experience for everyone, everywhere. Before that, I obtained an advanced Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium, with *Magna cum laude* distinction, while my master's thesis was accepted as a full-paper at the [LIDTA-2022 workshop](https://lidta.dcc.fc.up.pt/), co-located with [ECML/PKDD 2022](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/).

I find the idea of pushing the human boundaries using technology exciting and motivating and I believe in the responsibility of making the world a better place for future generations. During my past roles, I managed to learn different technology stacks in short periods of time and I collaborated and exchanged knowledge and opinions with amazing people.
